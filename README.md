## Requirements

### Functional requirements

1. Users could be authenticated anonymously, no need to take a phone number or email.
   Upon first installation the app should ask for their name and (Bonus!) image.
2. The application should track the user footsteps and update them in real-time, meaning
   while the app is in the foreground, and the user walks around, they should be able to
   see the steps counter increasing.
3. For each number of footsteps taken, a function must run to exchange it to ‚ÄúHealth
   Points‚Äù, e.g., 100 footsteps = 1 Health Point.
4. There should be a history that lists all the exchanges that happened by date and time
   (e.g., ‚Äú+10 health points on 24 April, 12 AM‚Äù), along with any redemption (e.g., ‚Äú-120
   health points spent in Jarir on 25 April, 4 PM‚Äù).
5. Show a visual feedback (e.g., Snack bar) when users gain extra points.
6. There should be a catalog of rewards so users can pick a reward they like and redeem it.
   Each reward is linked to one partner (e.g., 150 SAR off on Digital Watches from Jarir).
7. Rewards are paid with health points, feedback should be given upon all cases: if the
   redemption can happen, show a confirmation dialog, if it cannot due to a low number of
   points, show an error message stating clearly what‚Äôs wrong.
8. (Bonus!) There is a leaderboard page where the user can see their ranking (how many
   steps they have made since installing the app) compared to all other users, to encourage
   them to walk more.
9. (Bonus!) If the application is in background, or turned off, the exchange will happen
   while they are walking, and a notification would be sent from the app telling them that
   they gained extra points.
10. (Bonus!) The app is multilingual, supports both Arabic and English.

### Non-functional requirements

1. Usable and user-friendly interface.
2. Follow Material design rules.
3. Use a proper architecture for the code, UI code must not include any DB queries or
   business logic.
4. Use clear models for data.
5. Document every function and provide meaningful variable names and follow Effective
   Dart to write your code.
6. (Bonus!) Dark mode.
7. (Bonus!) Privacy and security (e.g., Firestore database rules).
8. (Bonus!) The project is null-safe.
